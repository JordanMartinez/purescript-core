-- | The `Eff` type constructor is used to represent _native_ effects.
-- |
-- | See [Handling Native Effects with the Eff Monad](http://www.purescript.org/learn/eff/) for more details.
-- |
-- | The first type parameter is a row of effects which represents the contexts in which a computation can be run, and the second type parameter is the return type.
foreign import data Eff :: # ! -> * -> *

foreign import returnE :: forall e a. a -> Eff e a

foreign import bindE :: forall e a b. Eff e a -> (a -> Eff e b) -> Eff e b

-- | The `Pure` type synonym represents _pure_ computations, i.e. ones in which all effects have been handled.
-- |
-- | The `runPure` function can be used to run pure computations and obtain their result.
type Pure a = Eff () a

-- | Run a pure computation and return its result.

-- | Loop until a condition becomes `true`.
-- |
-- | `untilE b` is an effectful computation which repeatedly runs the effectful computation `b`,
-- | until its return value is `true`.
foreign import untilE :: forall e. Eff e Boolean -> Eff e Unit

-- | Loop while a condition is `true`.
-- |
-- | `whileE b m` is effectful computation which runs the effectful computation `b`. If its result is
-- | `true`, it runs the effectful computation `m` and loops. If not, the computation ends.
foreign import whileE :: forall e a. Eff e Boolean -> Eff e a -> Eff e Unit

-- | Loop over a consecutive collection of numbers.
-- |
-- | `forE lo hi f` runs the computation returned by the function `f` for each of the inputs
-- | between `lo` (inclusive) and `hi` (exclusive).
foreign import forE :: forall e. Number -> Number -> (Number -> Eff e Unit) -> Eff e Unit

-- | Loop over an array of values.
-- |
-- | `foreach xs f` runs the computation returned by the function `f` for each of the inputs `xs`.
foreign import foreachE :: forall e a. Array a -> (a -> Eff e Unit) -> Eff e Unit
